### Hey there, welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm Mike, a passionate ML Engineer with a strong focus on computer vision projects. I thrive on exploring the endless possibilities that machine learning offers.

My journey revolves around Python, PyTorch, where I leverage their power to bring innovative solutions to life. Whether it's building cutting-edge models or diving deep into data analysis, I'm always up for the challenge.

When it comes to CV projects, I'm in my element. From object detection to image segmentation, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible. OpenCV has become my trusted companion, enabling me to extract meaningful insights from visual data.

But my skills don't stop there! I'm also well-versed in C++ and .Net, allowing me to create efficient and robust implementations for a variety of applications.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you'll find my latest projects and research endeavors. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting ML ventures together!
